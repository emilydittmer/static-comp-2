# static-comp-2

This was a project to test our knowledge with HTML and CSS, especially using grid. We were asked to replicate the below comp and then add both hover states and media queries. If I would have had more time to complete this. I would have like to have cleaner transitions on my media queries and better use of percentages in sizing.
